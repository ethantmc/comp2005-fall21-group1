Instructions: 
To run the program, download "NewCS2005.jar"

To inspect the code, you can check out the source files in Group 1 Iteration 4/Game of Focus - Final Release Java Files

Parts of the academic submissions can also all be found in each iteration folder, and while those files are no longer representative of any team member's skills or understanding, the "Marker Please Read" files may prove useful acknowledgments of shortcomings and corners cut to meet delivery.
